## 📘 Overview
This project is a **console-based calculator application** built in Java.  
The purpose of this refactor was to transition from a simple procedural design into a **modular, object-oriented program** using classes and objects.  

The app demonstrates core software development principles including **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, and **separation of concerns**.  
It validates user input, handles runtime errors gracefully, and manages resources efficiently through the use of **try-with-resources**.
